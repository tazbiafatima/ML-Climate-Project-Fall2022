# Week 8: - Ongoing will update as and when I wrap up for week 8 to start on week 9 
## Where I'm at: 
Data preprocessed

## What's next: 
Bangladesh vs Pakistan case study 
.ipynb upload to github
Draw a graph with potential variables, events and indicators that occured before both the 2010 and 2022 floods for Pakistan and 2022 floods for Bangladesh, similar to a causal graph model.

# Week 7:
Was sick this week Was not able to work on the project. 

# Week 6:
## Where I'm at:
Preprocessing Data that I found on the variables :
Volume of rainfall 
Sealevel 
Draught 
Dryness
I worked on finding climate indicators or smaller climate events leading up to the floods. Sifting threough news articles and available data to see if I notice any spikes or falls. 
Bangladesh vs Pakistan case study 
## Challenges: 
Gathering topographic data. Still looking for any existing work that quantified climate events due to landscape and terrains. Infrtsructure played a key role in incressing the devastation of the floods, as dams broke, no climate crisis infrastructure, proximity of indus river to humans settlements etc. 
Work Weather Attribution Project listen the return period of these floods as 1 in 100 years. I want to see if the same was said about the 2010 floods. 
## What's next: 
Find a similar model or design a model - research 
Work on this - Draw a graph with potential variables, events and indicators that occured before both the 2010 and 2022 floods for Pakistan and 2022 floods for Bangladesh, similar to a causal graph model.

# Week 5:
## Where I'm at: 
Continued Data Collection but found some other variables and thinking if I need to first perform a causal analysis of the factors or indicators like the La Nina effect, or the glacier shrinkage and the draught as possible indicators of Floods? I could also get the data that ministry of Pakistan or the World Weather Watch releases. 
## What I found: 
- World Weather Attribution Project is performing an analysis on what contributed to the Pakistan floods. They might release it in the coming weeks.
- Upon further research I found that Bangladesh is highly prone to flooding but has set an example of how to be prepared and monitor the early signs of floods.
- I also found out that Pakistan had similarly devastative floods in 2010 and the death toll then was higher than what it is in 2022, indicating that Pakistan's climate change ministry has adopted early-warning signs monitoring.
- I found a chronological order of floods - May-June : Bangladesh and NorthEast India. Aug-Sept: Pakistan. 
- I found that air-pollution could also be a cause of glacier shrinkage and there were "glacier lakes that overflowed breaking the dams of ice"? [Need to look this up]. 
## Challenges: 
- I'm unsure on where to start? Do I start with a causal model, so I figure out which indicators or measurements hold most indicative value to the floods? 
- How do I get measurements for the La Nina effect?
## What's next: 
- For the timeframe I think I will have to look at data from atleast five or ten years before the 2010 floods in pakistan and also look at the timeperiod from 2010 to 2022. 
- Find data from Pakistans ministry of Climate change on what their measurements of climate monitoring were before these floods. See if they exist for 2010 as well. 
- Find Air pollution and emissions data of Pakistan. 
- Could it also be possible that the 2010 floods contributed or accelerated the occurence of the 2022 floods? Do I research this angle ? 
- Draw a graph with potential variables, events and indicators that occured before both the 2010 and 2022 floods for Pakistan and 2022 floods for Bangladesh, similar to a causal graph model. 

# Week 4: 
## Where I'm at: 
Finalising hypothesis, Literature Review and Data Collection. 
 Previously I wasn't successful in finding relevant research about long-term global impacts of emissions by individual countries.Even a basic google search "did europe contribute to pakistan floods" yields no leads to any research or analysis. 
After discussing with the Professor, I decided to pursue the angle of what climate indicators couldve predicted the floods and if these can be used to predict percentage points of how likely a neighbouring country in the Indian Subcontinent is to flash-flooding like this. 
## What I found: 
- I'm compiling a list of climate indicators like global heat index of the surface, heatwave variables, glacier shrinkage, permafrost level, sea level, volume of rainfall. These are possible features of my model. 
- I also read about the earth being in its third year of the La Nina effect - which causes dry weather in the southern or mid-latitude parts of the Earth. It is linked to the draughts in Afghanistan. And, I've read draught or parched land/soil is an indicator of flash floods as there is low soaking. 
- I've started my data collection on each of these indicators or variables, I started aggregating just the values for the last ten years. 
## Challenges: 
Deciding the timeframe in which we will analyse the occurence of these indicators before the 2022 floods.
## What's next: 
Continue research and data collectiion. Flesh out hypothesis, about exactly what you need and whats the next step in the analysis or which model to buid. 
 
# Week 3: 
## Where I'm at: 
Refining the hypothesis or abstract of my project. I read news coverage of the Floods and their impact to gain more insight. 
## What I found: 
A lot of the articles mentioned countries in the global north that have longer historic contribution to pollutions and GHG emissions as the culprit of climate change and hence these floods.
## Challenges: 
Where to start and the vastness of this idea. 
## What's next: 
More research, maybe look up science papers that have measured cross-continental impact of emissions or climate change before
