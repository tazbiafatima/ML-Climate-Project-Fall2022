# Week 12: (Ongoing)
## Where I'm at:
Create DAG. Null hypothesis. Looking into time-series causal inference. 
## Challenges: 

## What's next: 


# Week 11: (Thanksgiving weekend)
## Where I'm at:
Initial hypothesis was to build a prediction model. Streamlining it to perform causal inference of the immediate climate events on the floods. There are two dates standing out. 
Apply black-box LSTM for a bake-off with existing parameters. 
## Challenges: 
Clean up causal inference implementation .
## What's next: 
Create DAG and run white-box Causal Inference. 

# Week 10:
## Where I'm at:
Calculated Pearson's correlation coefficient for data variables to see if there are strong links. 
Black box implementation of grangercausality wthout a causal graph.
Narrow down study area by latitude and longitude of the Northern region of Pakistan vs Southern regions of Sindh and Balochistan. Reasons of floods are different for both regions. 
## Challenges: 
Not accounting for riverine floods due to lack of comprehensive data.
## What's next: 
Streamlining research project to only data from the month of April 2022 i.e., short-term data to the floods to create causal grpah of draught index, soil wetness, runoff, glacial lake outbursts, tropical depression in Bay of Bengal, pre-monsoon rainfall in the April, May, June months and tropical rainfall in the July, August months. 

# Week 9:
## Where I'm at:
Lit review of Bangladesh vs Pakistan Floods case study. 
There are multiple reasons why the floods are differents. Cannot infer any similarities due to geographical and topographic differences. 
Performed Regression to see what the distribution type is for time-series precipitation, soil wetness, SST, temperature, draught index from 1980-present for Pakistan.
## Challenges: 
Causal Graph
## What's next: 
Find correlations first

# Week 8: - 
## Where I'm at: 
Data preprocessed

## What's next: 
Bangladesh vs Pakistan case study 
.ipynb upload to github
Draw a graph with potential variables, events and indicators that occured before both the 2010 and 2022 floods for Pakistan and 2022 floods for Bangladesh, similar to a causal graph model.

# Week 7:
Was sick this week Was not able to work on the project. 

# Week 6:
## Where I'm at:
Preprocessing Data that I found on the variables :
Volume of rainfall 
Sealevel 
Draught 
Dryness
I worked on finding climate indicators or smaller climate events leading up to the floods. Sifting threough news articles and available data to see if I notice any spikes or falls. 
Bangladesh vs Pakistan case study 
## Challenges: 
Gathering topographic data. Still looking for any existing work that quantified climate events due to landscape and terrains. Infrtsructure played a key role in incressing the devastation of the floods, as dams broke, no climate crisis infrastructure, proximity of indus river to humans settlements etc. 
Work Weather Attribution Project listen the return period of these floods as 1 in 100 years. I want to see if the same was said about the 2010 floods. 
## What's next: 
Find a similar model or design a model - research 
Work on this - Draw a graph with potential variables, events and indicators that occured before both the 2010 and 2022 floods for Pakistan and 2022 floods for Bangladesh, similar to a causal graph model.

# Week 5:
## Where I'm at: 
Continued Data Collection but found some other variables and thinking if I need to first perform a causal analysis of the factors or indicators like the La Nina effect, or the glacier shrinkage and the draught as possible indicators of Floods? I could also get the data that ministry of Pakistan or the World Weather Watch releases. 
## What I found: 
- World Weather Attribution Project is performing an analysis on what contributed to the Pakistan floods. They might release it in the coming weeks.
- Upon further research I found that Bangladesh is highly prone to flooding but has set an example of how to be prepared and monitor the early signs of floods.
- I also found out that Pakistan had similarly devastative floods in 2010 and the death toll then was higher than what it is in 2022, indicating that Pakistan's climate change ministry has adopted early-warning signs monitoring.
- I found a chronological order of floods - May-June : Bangladesh and NorthEast India. Aug-Sept: Pakistan. 
- I found that air-pollution could also be a cause of glacier shrinkage and there were "glacier lakes that overflowed breaking the dams of ice"? [Need to look this up]. 
## Challenges: 
- I'm unsure on where to start? Do I start with a causal model, so I figure out which indicators or measurements hold most indicative value to the floods? 
- How do I get measurements for the La Nina effect?
## What's next: 
- For the timeframe I think I will have to look at data from atleast five or ten years before the 2010 floods in pakistan and also look at the timeperiod from 2010 to 2022. 
- Find data from Pakistans ministry of Climate change on what their measurements of climate monitoring were before these floods. See if they exist for 2010 as well. 
- Find Air pollution and emissions data of Pakistan. 
- Could it also be possible that the 2010 floods contributed or accelerated the occurence of the 2022 floods? Do I research this angle ? 
- Draw a graph with potential variables, events and indicators that occured before both the 2010 and 2022 floods for Pakistan and 2022 floods for Bangladesh, similar to a causal graph model. 

# Week 4: 
## Where I'm at: 
Finalising hypothesis, Literature Review and Data Collection. 
 Previously I wasn't successful in finding relevant research about long-term global impacts of emissions by individual countries.Even a basic google search "did europe contribute to pakistan floods" yields no leads to any research or analysis. 
After discussing with the Professor, I decided to pursue the angle of what climate indicators couldve predicted the floods and if these can be used to predict percentage points of how likely a neighbouring country in the Indian Subcontinent is to flash-flooding like this. 
## What I found: 
- I'm compiling a list of climate indicators like global heat index of the surface, heatwave variables, glacier shrinkage, permafrost level, sea level, volume of rainfall. These are possible features of my model. 
- I also read about the earth being in its third year of the La Nina effect - which causes dry weather in the southern or mid-latitude parts of the Earth. It is linked to the draughts in Afghanistan. And, I've read draught or parched land/soil is an indicator of flash floods as there is low soaking. 
- I've started my data collection on each of these indicators or variables, I started aggregating just the values for the last ten years. 
## Challenges: 
Deciding the timeframe in which we will analyse the occurence of these indicators before the 2022 floods.
## What's next: 
Continue research and data collectiion. Flesh out hypothesis, about exactly what you need and whats the next step in the analysis or which model to buid. 
 
# Week 3: 
## Where I'm at: 
Refining the hypothesis or abstract of my project. I read news coverage of the Floods and their impact to gain more insight. 
## What I found: 
A lot of the articles mentioned countries in the global north that have longer historic contribution to pollutions and GHG emissions as the culprit of climate change and hence these floods.
## Challenges: 
Where to start and the vastness of this idea. 
## What's next: 
More research, maybe look up science papers that have measured cross-continental impact of emissions or climate change before
