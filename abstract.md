One third of Pakistan is currently flooding today, taking at least 1100 lives and displacing 33 million people. This comes after the country experienced a heatwave in May and June 2022 subsequently causing melting of the mountain ice caps which coupled with the heavy monsoon rains have caused these floods. This indicates a crippling global climate crisis. Multiple countries observed concurrent heatwaves this summer. Even Antarctica was at its lowest sea ice cover in February 2022. In my project, I would like to analyze the correlation between the environmental impacts of the top five industries in countries that have suffered climate change related natural disasters in the past five years and record changes in climate change indicators like urban heat island and heat-related deaths. With this analysis, I would like to layout the timeline and the patterns that lead up to these disasters. Another direction, I would like to pursue is to analyze the impact of these natural disasters on the global sea level and air pollution.
